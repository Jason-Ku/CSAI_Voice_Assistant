# Nimbus False Activation Detection

This script take audio file(s) that presumably do not contain the wake word
("Nimbus"), perform prediction on every 2.432s frame with .128s strides, and
save the frame as a wav file if it's predicted to be the wake word. The output
wav files should then be used to train the model to be more robust against
false activation.

Prereqs: numpy, speechpy, keras (or tensorflow), pydub, and ffmpeg. You can
install ffmpeg with "brew install ffmpeg" if you have homebrew installed, or
download it from https://ffmpeg.org. Other prereqs are python libraries and can
be installed with "pip install library".

Usage:  python false_pos_detect.py model source target_dir [name]
Where:  model is a HDF5 dump of the model you're training on.
        source is an audio file or a directory (the script will recursively go
            through the tree and ignore non-audio files)
        target_dir is the directory where the false positive frames should be
            output.
        name (optional) is your name. You can modify the global NAME in the
            script to avoid having to type it.

Formats supported: raw, wav, mp3, and all other formats supported by FFmpeg
