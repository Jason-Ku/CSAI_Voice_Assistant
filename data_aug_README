# Nimbus Data Augmentation and Generator

This module provides 2 classes, AudioAugmenter and DataGenerator. The
AudioAugmenter is a wrapper for raw audio bytes that provides methods for audio
manipulation, currently supporting padding, changing pitch, adding random
noise, and speeding up audio. DataGenerator is a generator-like object that can
be fed into the train functions of TensorFlow; it should be initialized with
audio segments (or raw bytes) and randomly applies augmentation methods from
AudioAugmenter to them.

Prereqs: Pydub and NumPy
