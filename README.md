The "Cal Poly Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence" club is designing a voice assistant to provide the Cal Poly Computer Science department with relavent information about the department and university. The intent is for users to ask for information about the department such as professor's office hours & expertise, course prerequisites, etc. Users can also ask the assistant for general information about the university such as the history, mascott, and more.

**Project Manager & Lead:** Chidi Ewenike

Project Phases:

# Spring 2019: Wake Word

**Active Software Developers:** Eli Bakshi, Michael Fekadu, Kalen Goo, Tyler Herzog, Viet Nguyen, Kyaw Soe

Currently designing the wake-word solution for the voice assistant. This is to create a 
speech recognition application layer for the assistant. Currently collecting data to extract MFCCs as input features to feed the GRU RNN.




# Summer 2019: Data Acquisition/Optimization
Natural Language Processing data acquisition and optimization of the current wake word solution.

# Fall 2019: Natural Language Processing Domain-Specific Implementation 
Applying the NLP layer and optimizing to make accurate queries for accurate predictions. Also scripting a site scraping program to obtain necessary information and adding such information to a look-up table for future access.

# Winter 2020: Infrastructure - Hardware/Mobile Application Design
Finalzing the NLP layer and implementing Google Cloud Platform Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech. The hardware and mobile application design will occur to complete the project for the end-to-end product.
